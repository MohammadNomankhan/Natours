Natours - Nature + tours

Project will be done in this way
  1. Writing html for one page
  2. Style it 
  3. Repeat 1 and 2 for each page
  
So far the first page is built and it is with pure css.
Some concepts like keyframes, flexbox and some intresting powers css offers which I was not aware, you can look onto more in css, at end I have written short notes.
