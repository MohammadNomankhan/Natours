	Notes
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	for *
 	Made margin and pading 0, these are default which browsers provide 
 	box-sizing: border-box, allows us to be consistent, avoid that overlap thing.
 	---
 	for body 
 	overall typography of body, then we can just change for components we want	
 	---
 	for .header
 	new thing - We can provide multiple bg-img by adding commas(,) 
	bg-position, this is like I have fixed it at top here, 
	now if browser screen will be resized then it will cropped from other than top, you got that
	new thing - we learned about clip-path 
	---
	for .logo-box & text-box
	positioned according to .header
	---
	for .primary-header
	backface-visibility: hidden; - that little upwards movement of .headin-primary fixed
	---
	for box-shadow
	figuring out ri8 values takes experience but as a trick remember this by 5-10-20 rule for box shadow 
	just in case you don't know that translate values are in accordance to original state
	---
	for .btn::after
	We made that water like thing on hover by using after 
	didn't knew this, quickly saw mdn docs
	no content with border radius same as btn and position too, height and with are 100%
	left and top 0 makes it possible to align acc to parent wiz .btn
	I avoid using z-index but this is small conponent so its ok
	---
	for .btn - this is css best practice
	As we will use same btn config with diff colors

	---
	
	new thing - How CSS is parsed?

	Cascaded -> value processing -> visual formating -> rendered website
	1.Cascaded
		about !important, specificity, last declaration override 
	2. value processing
		declared - cascaded - specified - relative to px - used - actual
	3. visual formating
		box sizing - how height and width become actual params 
		block, inline, inline-block
		float - relative, left, right etc and absolute, fixed

	---
	new thing - BEM Metholology
	B - block :Standalone component
	E - element :dependent on block
	M - Modifier :some modifier like color, shape etc of a button for eg

	---
 
	Background-clip: text 
	color: transparent
	bg-img: graient or img
	Very amazing prop, with help of this you can add bg but in clipped are

	---
	transform: skewX or Y or in both dir

	in Y its like that standing y line pr 10 deg se tilt kro
	same with X.
	---
	[class^="col-"] {
	// css
	} 

	this ^ here means whatever class start with col-
	apply this css
	---
	:not psueodo class is also amazing
	---
	calc function in css which is very powerfull 
	---
	how we adjusted that cliped are by -20rem margin using the concept that total is 95vh and that cliiped is at 75vh 
	so 95-75 = 20
	---
	we are building muscle of naming variables as much we can so that we just have to change one var when we wanna have diff sizes
